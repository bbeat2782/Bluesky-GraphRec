## Methods
### Overview
We use a **two-stage recommendation pipeline**:
1. **Candidate Generation**: Uses **collaborative filtering** and **consumer-producer embeddings** to efficiently generate a list of candidate posts for each user.
2. **Ranking**: Employs **GraphRec**, a transformer-based ranking model that incorporates:
   - Temporal graph learning
   - Node interaction embeddings
   - Efficient patching techniques for scalability

## Evaluation & Metrics
### Key Metrics
To evaluate our model, we focus on both **ranking quality** and **diversity**:
- **Hit Rate@K**: Measures how often the correct post appears in the top-K recommendations.
- **Recall@K**: Evaluates the modelâ€™s ability to retrieve relevant posts.
- **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Assesses ranking accuracy by considering the position of the first relevant recommendation.
- **Intra-List Diversity (ILD)**: Measures content variety within recommendations to avoid redundancy.
