## Project Overview
This project explores how **Graph Transformers** improve **personalized content discovery** in decentralized social networks like **Bluesky**. Unlike traditional platforms, Bluesky lacks a central recommendation system, making it challenging to surface relevant content.  

We evaluate **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and **Graph Transformers** for **user-post interactions**, assessing their effectiveness using ranking and diversity metrics to understand their impact on content visibility.
